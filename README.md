This project has a board to keep issues and to-do lists organized.

The project board can be found [here](https://github.com/andrewmcgov/express-cms/projects/1)

The project board is split into columns
- Initiatives: big ideas that will be broken down into smalller pieces, either as issues or cards
- To do: these are single task items that will usually be linked to an issue & PR
- Selected: This is a way of knowing what the other developers are working on
- Waiting on Review: Title says it all - don't let these sit for too long!

Got bugs? Make an issue!
